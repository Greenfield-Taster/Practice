            Currently, emphasis is placed on combining Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl
            Virus (TYLCV) and Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) resistances with
            other soil borne diseases into superior tomato breeding lines and
            hybrids. Moreover, comprehensive efforts are being undertaken to
            develop varieties resistance to TBRFV virus (Tomato Brown Rugose
            Fruit Virus).
